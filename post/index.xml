This work was a continuation on my uncertainty and sustainability research for big data streams (mostly focused on Video streams).
I believe that more and more people are aware of the effects of many real-world uncertainties and the necessity of providing sustainable (less energy) solutions for this kind of big data applications. One could even say that&amp;hellip; people are more certain on the effect of these uncertainties *pun intended* .</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Publications as Main Author on my PhD</title><link>https://arruda.github.io/post/fuzzy-publications-phd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 15:28:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://arruda.github.io/post/fuzzy-publications-phd/</guid><description>Today was finally published my first papers (as the main author) during my PhD =D.
These are two papers on the same conference on fuzzy logic (FUZZ-IEEE 2023).
The first one is: A Comparative Study of Open-Source Fuzzy Modelling Toolkit Licenses and Features.
The second one is: Fuzzy vs. Crisp in Uncertainty-Aware Service Selection: Enabling Sustainability on Multimedia Event Processing.
I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here the accepted versions just to keep them safe.</description></item><item><title>My First Master Research Publication</title><link>https://arruda.github.io/post/first-to-be-master-publication/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 21:05:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://arruda.github.io/post/first-to-be-master-publication/</guid><description>Finally, I got my first (short)paper accepted for publication during my Master research.
I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here a pre-print version just to keep it safe. The final version is yet to be published(was already published, see edit note) at the EdgeWays 2020 workshop, in European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing. Springer, Cham, 2020 (or something like that, not sure exactly until it is published).
Edited: Yay! The paper is now published!</description></item></channel></rss>
