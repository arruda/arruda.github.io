These are two papers on the same conference on fuzzy logic (FUZZ-IEEE 2023).
The first one is: A Comparative Study of Open-Source Fuzzy Modelling Toolkit Licenses and Features.
The second one is: Fuzzy vs. Crisp in Uncertainty-Aware Service Selection: Enabling Sustainability on Multimedia Event Processing.

I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here a pre-print version just to keep it safe. The final version is yet to be published(was already published, see edit note) at the EdgeWays 2020 workshop, in European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing. Springer, Cham, 2020 (or something like that, not sure exactly until it is published).
Edited: Yay! The paper is now published!</description></item></channel></rss>
