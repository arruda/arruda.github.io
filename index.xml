&lt;p>This work was a continuation on my uncertainty and sustainability research for big data streams (mostly focused on Video streams).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe that more and more people are aware of the effects of many real-world uncertainties and the necessity of providing sustainable (less energy) solutions for this kind of big data applications. One could even say that&amp;hellip; people are more certain on the effect of these uncertainties &lt;em>*pun intended*&lt;/em> .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, just to give an very brief idea, we show in the paper that one can save almost up to 10% of a Cloud server energy consumption in one year, if one decides to take into account the effects of some uncertainties present in the application. For reference, that&amp;rsquo;s more than the electricity consumed by a Tesla car in a round-trip of 1000km (from Amsterdam to Paris, and back). You can check more about this, and some other reference numbers in the paper that I linked bellow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m again, posting my accepted version to keep this copy for myself. Inside the PDF there is a link to the final published version on IEEE Xplore.:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are two papers on the same conference on fuzzy logic (FUZZ-IEEE 2023).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first one is: &lt;a href="https://arruda.github.io/papers/A_Comparative_Study_of_Open-Source_Fuzzy_Modelling_Toolkit_Licenses_and_Features.pdf">A Comparative Study of Open-Source Fuzzy Modelling Toolkit Licenses and Features&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second one is: &lt;a href="https://arruda.github.io/papers/Fuzzy_vs_Crisp_in_Uncertainty-Aware_Service_Selection_Enabling_Sustainability_on_Multimedia_Event_Processing.pdf">Fuzzy vs. Crisp in Uncertainty-Aware Service Selection: Enabling Sustainability on Multimedia Event Processing&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here the accepted versions just to keep them safe. Inside the PDFs there is a link to the final published version on IEEE Xplore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add all the papers to another page at some point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact me</title><link>https://arruda.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:04:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://arruda.github.io/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can email me, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to hear from you.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here a pre-print version just to keep it safe. The final version &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->is yet to be published&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> (&lt;strong>was already published, see edit note&lt;/strong>) at the EdgeWays 2020 workshop, in European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing. Springer, Cham, 2020 (or something like that, not sure exactly until it is published).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edited&lt;/strong>: Yay! The paper is now published!
