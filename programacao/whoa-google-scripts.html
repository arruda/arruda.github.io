      <p>I just found out this new Google Script thing, and after some testing I decided that would do a review for it.</p>
<h2>How I Found This</h2>
<p>For a long time I've been looking for a way to get all my old emails and chats with my GF(since the email she used then was another and lost to her). I could go one by one in my Gmail, and forward it to her new one, but this would be unthinkable (since there were a LOT of emails).</p>
<p>And finally I found this Google Script, and after one day playing with it, all those emails where already forwarded to her new gmail... Yes, it was very easy.</p>
<h2>What is this GoogleScript</h2>
<p>Basically it's a JavaScript that offers you access to many GoogleApps services, and let you use then(with some limitations) to create something new, or simply automate a job.</p>
<h2>Creating a New Google Script</h2>
<p>To create a new google script you can go to: <a href="https://script.google.com/">https://script.google.com/</a><br/>
Or go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/" title="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>(or Google Docs if you haven't migrated yet) and create a new <strong>"Script"</strong>.</p>
<p>After this you can create a <strong>Empty Project</strong> and already start working on it!</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>There are lots... I mean, lots...<br/>
In this page you can find everything you need to get started: <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">https://developers.google.com/apps-script/</a>.</p>
<p>And also if you have any doubts you can check the StackOverflow Tag: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-apps-script" title="google-apps-script">google-apps-script</a> that is the official support center for this.</p>
<h2>What can be done?</h2>
<p>Well, many things, as you can see, it can be made to create some simple scripts for you and/or your company to automate things for you.<br/>
Like, creating a Google Docs, at the beginning at a meeting(in Google Calendar), with some content like the header of the document, and other things right from the Calendar.<br/>
So if you have a meeting now, and the Event in the Calendar is called "Superb Meeting", it could create a doc, share it for everyone in the company, and put the content:<br/>
<strong>"This is the report of what was discussed in the: "Superb Meeting", at "Time of the meeting"</strong></p>
<p>You can also use it to create some more complex applications, or even games, and put them in the Web Store.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I believe that everyone that uses the Google Apps in a intense way should take a look at this, and you'll see that with just a bit of effort you can make some improvement in the use of these technologies.</p>
<p>And yes, it's very easy to use, they have it very well documented (Even myself, a monkey in JS, managed to use it).</p>
<p>That's for now.</p>
